Keeara Rhoades Artist Site

Mirrors and eyes, fences and disguise -- regardless of how others define us, or shield us, I think of beauty as empathy -- the enigma that continually tempts me to provoke boundaries, exposing tensions and bonds that develop within and inspire my multimedia narratives. Whether inside a dugout, a camper trailer, or alongside a Pretty Fence, all my self-performed characters entertain the gap between liminal clarity and misunderstood realities.
